      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a burgeoning software developer currently currently enrolled in Code 201 at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA.  Originally from Houston, Texas, I've lived all over the United States and even overseas in India.  I consider myself to be well-traveled.
        Married, I'm also the co-creator of my son Sami.</p>

      <h2>Why Do I Want to Become a Developer?</h2>
      <p>Why Do I Want to Become a Software Developer?
It wasn't a quick, easy decision by any means.  Having spent the last 14 years in Federal IT operations support (helpdesk) and security compliance, I decided I need something more creative.  I first heard about coding five years ago
through a friend of mine who was trying to convince me to get into the field. </p>
